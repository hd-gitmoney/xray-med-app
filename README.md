# Hack.Diversity Git Money Tech Dive Project

## Getting Started

This skeleton contains two different applications -- a front end, or "client," created with "Create React App," and a back end, or "API," created with Express. 

In order to make both of them work together, you'll need to run both, but you can run just one or the other to start. As you begin working on this project, you'll first focus on the client, so you can more or less ignore the API portion of the code for now.

## Client
In order to run the client, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd client/
npm i
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and see the client running. If you make changes in the `App.js` file, you should see them reflected.

## API
In order to run the server, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd api/
npm i
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:9000` in your browser and see the server running.

# Things to add
- Create a `.env` file in the api folder and add the following as `key=value` 
  - PORT= `can be any port example: 3000`
  - MONG_URI= `your database URI`
  
## Tools used
This Tech.Dive project was created using React, Express, Mongo.DB, Node.js, and BootstrapReact. 

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack website application that is used by doctors to track patient health information. This site will help doctors see the health impacts of covid-19, pneumonia, emphysema, and other lung infections. By using exam and x-ray data, doctors will be able to assess the lung health of their patients. 

Using the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) method, doctors will be able to update their radiology reports quickly and efficiently with our site. 

## Installation/Getting Started

To successfully complete this project you will use two different applications. The client side, or front-end, and the API or backend. For this project we started with the front end, using React, Express, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and connected it to our backend x-ray data using MongoDB and Node.js. 

## Usage:  (run full-stack app on your machine)
