# Hack.Diversity Git Money Tech Dive Project

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack website application that is used by doctors to track patient health information. This site will help doctors see the health impacts of covid-19, pneumonia, emphysema, and other lung infections. By using exam and x-ray data, doctors will be able to assess the lung health of their patients. 

Using the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) method, users will be able to add, edit, or delete exams. 

## Getting Started

This web app contains two different applications -- a front end, or "client," created with "Create React App," and a back end, or "API," created with Express. 


### Client
In order to run the client, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd client/
npm i
npm start
```

You should then be able to visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and see the client running. If you make changes in the `App.js` file, you should see them reflected.

### API
In order to run the server, you'll run the following commands:

```bash
cd api/
npm i
npm run dev
```

 
# Things to add
- Create a `.env` file in the api folder and add the following as `key=value` 
  - PORT= `can be any port example: 9000`
  - MONG_URI= `your database URI`



You should then be able to visit `localhost:3000` in your browser and see the server running.

## Installation/Getting Started

To successfully complete this project you will use two different applications. The client side, or front-end, and the API or backend. For this project we started with the front end, using React, Express, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and connected it to our backend x-ray data using MongoDB and Node.js.
